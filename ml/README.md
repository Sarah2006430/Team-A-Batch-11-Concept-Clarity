This module handles feature extraction, model training,
evaluation, and inference for driver state prediction.

## Dataset

We use a publicly available Kaggle dataset for driver drowsiness detection.
The dataset contains labeled images of drivers categorized as:
- Drowsy
- Non-Drowsy

Due to size and licensing constraints, the dataset is not stored in the repository.
